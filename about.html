        <h3>About the vision</h3>
        <h4>More than just desserts, we hope to raise awareness of social issues through our creations</h4>

        <h4> The story so far </h4>
        <p>From a young girl baking sweets with her mom, Hannah has always enjoyed creating desserts for herself
            and others. At the same time, baking is more than simply a time of fellowship and creation in the kitchen,
            but also a way for Hannah to contribute to something bigger than herself.</p>
        <p>In the 10th grade after hearing about orphans in Africa with AIDS she determined to help by selling her baked goods and donating all the 
            proceeds to an organization combating the issue. Hannah's heart for justice blossomed throughout her life,
            including spending time in India working with a survivor of human trafficking on the road to restoration.
            The pair would bake together as Hannah taught her English and would then share the desserts with others.</p>
        <p>More than just bringing sweetness into your life, these desserts are created to expose the darkness of human
            trafficking and slavery so that those who are oppressing others will get their <strong>just desserts</strong>
            and the survivors will have an opportunity to live in freedom. There are still over 20 million people being
            trafficked or in slavery. Each dessert purchased donates to one of our charity partners who work to raise
            awareness of this issue through the Houston area, as well as providing healing to the survivors of such 
            a crime. This about more than just desserts!
        </p>
